3. If you want splits, refer to [Setting up Splits](#setting-up-splits) at this point.
1. Right Click LiveSplit → Compare Against → Select `Game Time`, Look down to where it says: *Best Segments*, *Average Segments*...

## Setting up Splits
- Download [Blank Splits to 1000](https://github.com/oJumpy/IW7-Zombies-AutoTimers/releases/download/v1/Blank.to.1000.lss).
- Right Click LiveSplit → `Open Splits` → `From File...` → Browse to the splits file and select it.

## Custom Layouts
If you are going to make your own layout, make sure your LiveSplit is comparing against `Game Time` for everything. This includes `Subsplits`, `Splits`, `Timer`, `Detailed Timer`, etc.

For `Timing Method`, I recommend using `Current Timing Method`.
